[Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit/data) (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through [Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic). This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from around thirty Fitbit users. These eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.

**Is It Good Data?** 
* Reliable – the dataset is reliable as it comes from Fitbit users who consented to share their data
* Original – the dataset is original as it is directly from Fitbit users
* Comprehensive – with limited users and unequal data collection, the dataset is not very comprehensive 
* Current – the dataset is not current as it is from 2016 
* Cited – not apparent

**Data Limitations**
